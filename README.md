# Analog_Clock
An Analog Meter clock
Controlled by PIC32MZ EF

U1001 firmware is programmed onto U1001 with a PIC KIT 4 through header J801 (this is PIC32MZ EF firmware).

U1302 flash image is programmed onto U1302 through USB connector J1301 using FTProg (this is FTDI USB/UART bridge flash contents).

Analog panel meters are installed at MES1801, MES1901 and MES2001. Analog panel meters selected for this project were bought on ebay at: https://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-0-15V-Analog-Voltmeter-Analogue-Voltage-panel-meter-SO45-directly-Connect/183077594391?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649

Custom meter face plates are printed from a PDF in the /misc folder, to scale. They are inserted into the panel meters to allow the clock to display the time.
